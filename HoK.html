<p>honor of knights is a mobile (you might know already the answer)<span class="spoiler">moba</span>.<br>
   I usually play it when I don't have enough time for even a league of legends match, since the matches are really short.<br>
  The reason why I play this and not wild rift is because in wild rift the champs are abit different than in league so just I am not getting overwhelmed with tiny mistakes<br>
  Unfortunally I am in this game I am still very bad because I only play it for a very short time compared to the other MOBAs. <br>
